<h3>How do we use your Google account?</h3>

<p> We ask for a single permission: <b>View and manage Google Drive files that
you have opened or created with this app.</b> This permission lets us create
files in your Drive, and update those files later.  Also, if in the future we
provide a way for you to directly upload Pyret files and load them into
<code>code.pyret.org</code> from your Drive, you can explicitly grant
permission for this application to view and edit certain files.

<p> We use client-only authorization (if you're really interested, we use APIs
similar to the ones described in
https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/quickstart-js), so this
application can only access your data from open pages on our site.  We don't
save any access tokens to our server.
</p>

<p> You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and immediately remove all access that we have to your account.  Your programs
and <code>code.pyret.org</code> folder will <em>not</em> be deleted if you do
so, but you can always manually delete the folder and its contents yourself.
</p>


</p>

<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
We make a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and store all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.
</p>

<p> We can only see files that we created, so simply moving another file into
your <code>code.pyret.org</code> collection wonâ€™t cause it to show up in our
interface: you need to create the file manually through our editor.  </p>

<p> The listing of programs in this application only looks for the
<code>code.pyret.org</code> folder and its contents, so if you rename or remove
that folder, a new, empty one will be created for you on your next login.</p>
