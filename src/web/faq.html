<h3>Why do we ask for the permissions we do?</h3>

<p>
The login form asks for three permissions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>(1) Know who you are on Google, and (2) View your email address:</b>
We use <code>code.pyret.org</code> in schools, and for managing courses and
assignments, we need unique identifiers for students and teachers to coordinate.
We store your Google email address and a unique identifier given to us by
Google in our database as your account information.

We actually only ask Google for the “email” permission, but along with it
comes enough information to get data from your public Google+ profile, if you
have one.  We don't use this information, but it may pass through our servers.
</li>
<li>

<b>(3) View and manage Google Drive files that you have opened or created with this app:</b>
This permission lets us create files in your Drive, and update those files
later.  Also, if in the future we provide a way for you to directly upload
Pyret files and load them into <code>code.pyret.org</code> from your Drive, you
can explicitly grant permission for this application to view and edit certain
files.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also ask for <em>offline access</em>, though it doesn’t always display in
the permissions dialog.  This is so we can avoid popping up unnecessary
permissions dialogs during long editing sessions.  Offline access gives us a
special token that we store on our server that can give us the same access as
if you'd logged in without using the Google login window again.
</p>

<p>
You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and remove all access that we have to your account.  Your programs and
<code>code.pyret.org</code> folder will <em>not</em> be deleted if you do so,
but you can always manually delete the folder and its contents yourself.
</p>


</p>

<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
We make a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and store all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.
</p>

<p> We can only see files that we created, so simply moving another file into
your <code>code.pyret.org</code> collection won’t cause it to show up in our
interface: you need to create the file manually through our editor.  </p>

<p> The listing of programs in this application only looks for the
<code>code.pyret.org</code> folder and its contents, so if you rename or remove
that folder, a new, empty one will be created for you on your next login.</p>

<h3>Why is there an option to log out of Google, too?</h3>

<p>The logout button lets you either delete your session with
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, or log out of both this site and your Google
Account.  We do this because <code>code.pyret.org</code> is used in school
computer labs, and it's convenient to have a way to log out of both to leave
the computer in a fresh state for students who use it later.</p>
